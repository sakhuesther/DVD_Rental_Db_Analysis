Ques 1: We want to understand more about the movies that families are watching. The following categories are considered family movies: 
Animation, Children, Classics, Comedy, Family and Music.

Create a query that lists each movie, the film category it is classified in, and the number of times it has been rented out.

/*Query 1/*
SELECT
  f.title,
  c.name,
  COUNT(r.rental_id)
FROM film_category fc
JOIN category c
  ON c.category_id = fc.category_id
JOIN film f
  ON f.film_id = fc.film_id
JOIN inventory i
  ON i.film_id = f.film_id
JOIN rental r
  ON r.inventory_id = i.inventory_id
WHERE c.name IN ('Animation', 'Children', 'Classics', 'Comedy', 'Family', 'Music')
GROUP BY 1,
         2
ORDER BY 2, 1

Ques 2:Finally, provide a table with the family-friendly film category, each of the quartiles, 
and the corresponding count of movies within each combination of film category for each corresponding rental duration category. 
The resulting table should have three columns:

Category
Rental length category
Count

/*Query 2/*
SELECT
  t1.name,
  t1.standard_quartile,
  COUNT(t1.standard_quartile)

FROM (SELECT
  f.title,
  c.name,
  f.rental_duration,
  NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY f.rental_duration) AS standard_quartile

FROM film_category fc

JOIN category c

  ON c.category_id = fc.category_id

JOIN film f

  ON f.film_id = fc.film_id

WHERE c.name IN ('Animation', 'Children', 'Classics', 'Comedy', 'Family', 'Music')) t1

GROUP BY 1,
         2

ORDER BY 1, 2

Ques 3: We would like to know who were our top 10 paying customers, how many payments they made on a monthly basis during 2007, 
and what was the amount of the monthly payments. Can you write a query to capture the customer name, month and year of payment, 
and total payment amount for each month by these top 10 paying customers?

/*Query 3/*
SELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', p.payment_date) pay_month, c.first_name || ' ' || c.last_name AS full_name, COUNT(p.amount) AS pay_countpermon, SUM(p.amount) AS pay_amount
FROM customer c
JOIN payment p
ON p.customer_id = c.customer_id
WHERE c.first_name || ' ' || c.last_name IN
(SELECT t1.full_name
FROM
(SELECT c.first_name || ' ' || c.last_name AS full_name, SUM(p.amount) as amount_total
FROM customer c
JOIN payment p
ON p.customer_id = c.customer_id
GROUP BY 1	
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 10) t1) AND (p.payment_date BETWEEN '2007-01-01' AND '2008-01-01')
GROUP BY 2, 1
ORDER BY 2, 1, 3

Ques 4: We want to find out how the two stores compare in their count of rental orders during every month for all the years we have data for. 
Write a query that returns the store ID for the store, the year and month and the number of rental orders each store has fulfilled for that month. 
Your table should include a column for each of the following: year, month, store ID and count of rental orders fulfilled during that month.

/*Query 4/*
SELECT
  DATE_PART('month', r.rental_date) AS Rental_month,
  DATE_PART('year', r.rental_date) AS Rental_year,
  s.store_id AS Store_ID,
  COUNT(i.inventory_ID) AS Count_rentals
FROM rental r
JOIN inventory i
  ON i.inventory_id = r.inventory_id
JOIN store s
  ON i.store_id = s.store_id
GROUP BY 1,
         2,
         3
ORDER BY 1 DESC
